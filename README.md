# JavaScript Minesweeper

Built in vanilla JavaScript. 

# How to play

Contrary to popular belief, Minesweeper is actually quite simple. Click a square, you get a number. That number is the amount of mines surrounding it. If you guess the mine, you can mark it with a flag by right-clicking on it. The number of remaining flags is displayed at the top left and the timer is displayed at the top right. If you click on a mine, click the face at the top to restart.
